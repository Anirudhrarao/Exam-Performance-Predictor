# Simple linear Regression
Simple Linear Regression is a type of Regression algorithms that models the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable. The relationship shown by a Simple Linear Regression model is linear or a sloped straight line, hence it is called Simple Linear Regression.

The key point in Simple Linear Regression is that the dependent variable must be a continuous/real value. However, the independent variable can be measured on continuous or categorical values.
